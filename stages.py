        ~UP~DATE~
            Learned how to use numpy and matplotlib. Numpy is used for creating
            and working with n-dimensional arrays and matplotlib is used for
            generating scientific/mathematic graphs.

            I will be using pygame because the implementation is simpler to use
            and the interface is more of what I need; a cartoony graphic

        Learn how to use pygame
                #successfully drew rect and circle
            -create a 2D array using numpy
            -represent the 2D array graphically using pygame
            -change the cells on the 2D array, randomly at first

    Stage 2
        -implement cell updating between game states
        -figure out the conditional logic on changing cells
